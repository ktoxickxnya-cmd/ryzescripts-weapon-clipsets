# ryzescripts-weapon-clipsets
- Discord - [https://discord.gg/myt3wq2u]

**What it does**  
Lightweight FiveM client script that applies a custom **weapon movement clipset** (e.g., petrol/jerrycan carry) whenever a player equips a weapon. It automatically **pauses** the clipset while aiming, shooting, or reloading, and **reapplies** it after, so combat animations arenâ€™t broken. Supports group-wide rules (e.g., RIFLE/SHOTGUN) and per-weapon overrides by **name** (e.g., `WEAPON_M4A1`) or hash.
